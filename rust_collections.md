| **Weak**     | Non-owning reference to data managed by `Rc` or `Arc`.                                              | N/A                                              | Prevents reference cycles in `Rc` or `Arc` structures        | Cannot directly access data (must be upgraded to `Rc` or `Arc` to use)                    | Used with `Rc` and `Arc`            |
| **RefCell**  | Allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, even within immutable data structures.                   | Borrow: O(1)                                     | Allows interior mutability, useful with `Rc` for shared mutability | Runtime borrow-checking, which can cause panics if rules are violated                     | N/A                                 |
| **Cell**     | Allows mutable borrows within single-threaded contexts, designed for small Copy types.              | Set/Get: O(1)                                    | Efficient for small `Copy` types, provides interior mutability | Limited to `Copy` types only, lacks runtime checks                                       | N/A                                 |
