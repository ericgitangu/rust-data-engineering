Welcome to the **Rust Fundamentals** repository! This project is designed as a comprehensive learning resource for Rust, spanning from basic concepts to advanced techniques. It contains exercises, utilities, libraries, and CLI tools that cover essential Rust topics for developers who want to deepen their understanding of the language.

## üìù Overview

This repository serves as a guide to learn and practice Rust. The examples and tools provided here are structured to help learners grasp fundamental concepts in Rust, including:

- **Basic Rust Concepts**: Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, pattern matching, and control flow.
- **Standard Library Usage**: Working with core data types, handling errors with `Option` and `Result`, and leveraging Rust's unique features.
- **Libraries & Modules**: Small libraries such as `MathUtils`, `StringUtils`, `DateUtils`, and `FileIOUtils` that demonstrate how to encapsulate functionality in reusable modules.
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities built with `clap` to provide real-world examples of argument parsing, error handling, and result display.
- **Advanced Rust**: Examples on concurrency, multithreading, traits, and type system features unique to Rust.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each module and example is designed to be self-contained. To explore any example, clone the repository, navigate to the relevant directory, and use `cargo` to build and run the code:

```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-fundamentals.git

    # Navigate to any example
    cd rust-fundamentals/math_utils

    # Run the example
    cargo run -- example_command_here
```

## üìö Prerequisites
